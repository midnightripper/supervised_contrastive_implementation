# Repository Name: Unsupervised Contrastive Learning

## Description

This repository is dedicated to implementing and exploring unsupervised contrastive learning techniques, specifically in the context of deep neural networks. Unsupervised contrastive learning is a self-supervised learning approach that aims to learn useful representations from unlabeled data. By leveraging the idea of maximizing agreement between augmented views of the same instance while minimizing agreement between different instances, unsupervised contrastive learning enables the model to capture meaningful and discriminative features without relying on explicit labels.

## Key Features

- Implementation of various unsupervised contrastive learning algorithms
- Support for different deep neural network architectures and encoders
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization
- Training pipeline for unsupervised learning with contrastive loss
- Evaluation metrics for assessing learned representations
- Pre-trained models for transfer learning and downstream tasks

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unsupervised-contrastive-learning.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Set up the environment and activate it:

```
conda create -n unsup-contrastive-env python=3.9
conda activate unsup-contrastive-env
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: 
   - Ensure your data is in an appropriate format and stored in a suitable directory structure.
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalization, or augmentation.

2. Configure the training settings:
   - Adjust hyperparameters in the configuration file to customize the training process.
   - Specify the architecture, encoder, augmentation techniques, batch size, learning rate, etc.

3. Train the unsupervised contrastive learning model:
   - Run the training script to start the training process.
   - Monitor the training progress and save the best model checkpoints for future use.

4. Evaluate learned representations:
   - Utilize evaluation scripts to assess the quality of learned representations.
   - Compute evaluation metrics such as nearest neighbor accuracy or clustering performance.

5. Transfer learning and downstream tasks:
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained model on a specific task using labeled data.
   - Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on the target task.
